WARNING: THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE TO SLOW DOWN A COMPUTER --- I suggest you read the code first to figure everything out before you run it. If you do decide to run it, I believe I have CTR+F as the kill switch. It's been a while since I made this though so I'm not making any promises that that truly is the kill switch.
