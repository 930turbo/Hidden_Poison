# poizon-virus
Simple 'fake virus' I made back in highschool. Basically just a good way to prank and annoy friends. Requires kill button to be pressed to stop the program from booting on startup. I believe the kill key was cmd+f but it's been years since I've touched this project so it's on you. 

It hides itself as chrome in the startup menu so if you just disable to dupe Chome you're golden.
